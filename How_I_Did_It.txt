  G.I. JOE (COPY). (because of a challenge with my friend Stefy / RamJam)
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Recreating the original protection, without even reversing the loader code.

    A couple of hours ago, I asked on a facebook group what was the original
commodore 64 game more difficult to copy (not absolutely but between the
members of the group).
    A few people including Stefy of RamJam named G.I. Joe and I also remember
that at the time it was not easy to copy it using normal programs.
    So, as usual, I got curious and started to analyze it like I was in 1985:
	
	First I used "quick copy" to make a copy on another disk.
	I immediately noticed that the disk appears as a normal disk except for
	the fact that sector 20 of track 1 is "missing". (Error 20)
	
	So I made a quick program to seek for sector 19, skip the sector data
and the ending gap and read the next 512 bytes.

    Analyzing the read bytes (GCR) it was easy to understand that instead of
sector 20, there is another "sector 3".

    So, without even analyzing the loader which surely is heavily protected,
I imagine that all the loader does is to read sector 3 two or more times so
to get both data blocks. No mystery to be found in the loader if my theory
is correct.

    As a result of my theory, I wrote a quick and dirty program to seek until
sector 19 of track 1, then skip the data block and then write the second
"sector 3" that we read before and check if the game starts.

   By my surprise, the game started perfectly.
   
   I repackaged the game in two D64 files. Side A also contains a new program
called, as usual, "WP".

   All you have to do is: transfer the two D64 on the two sides of a normal disk.
Insert SIDE A of the disk and write:

   LOAD"WP",8
   
   and then RUN
   
   After that you can directly LOAD"GI*",8,1 and enjoy the game.
   
   This operation is needed only one time on a real disk.
   If you want to check it in an emulator using directly the D64, you will have
   to run "WP" every time, or first convert the D64 in a G64 and then ruun WP only once.
   
   That's all folks!
   Thanks for reading!
   
   A kiss to Stefy and a big hello to everyone in the commodore groups!
 
    Yours,
